1.- The Male gender purchases more than Female gender. Purchase Count column shows us that fact, Male 652,Female 113; however, when we look at the Avg Total Purchase per Person then we notice Female gender buys little bit more expensive games or Optional Items: Male: $4.07 and Female: $4.47

2.- Age Demographics Stats:   
The players who purchased optional items that enhance their playing experience
more frequently, belong to the range of age from 20 to 24 and in the second place, teens age from 15 to 19 years old.

3.- Most Profitable Items:
The most profitable optional item is Item ID 178, with 12 items purchased, the Item Price is $4.23 and the total value is $50.76 usd. May be the reason why is due to it has some popular features that help gamers to enhance their gaming experience and make it a more realistic experience.
As a Lead Analyst I would recommend to my boss at Independent Gaming Company, the Game Items Development Team also improve with some features Item Ids: 82 (Nirvana) and 92 (Final Critic), because they both have a higher ticket price (Item Price) of $4.90 and $4.88 each, and promote those new features in the range of ages who are bigger consumers as shown in point 2 (above), and also create an offer to Female Gender as they buy more expensive Game Optional Items.
Therefore they could increase revenue based on Total Purchase Value.
